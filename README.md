## Description
Our project idea is to create a tool that helps determine the maturity level of a searched movie. The tool will help users in assessing whether a movie is appropriate for a specific age group (or help those who want to avoid sensitive content) by analyzing its contents of movie by specific keywords (ex: animal cruelty, abuse, violence, etc).
